Description: Virtual machine introspection library
 LibVMI is a virtual machine introspection library. This means that it helps
 you access the memory of a running virtual machine. LibVMI provides primatives
 for accessing this memory using physical or virtual addresses and kernel
 symbols. LibVMI also supports accessing memory from a physical memory
 snapshot, which is helpful for debugging or forensic analysis.
 .
 In addition to memory access, LibVMI supports memory events. Events provide
 notifications when registered regions of memory are executed, written to, or
 read. Memory events require hypervisor support and are currently only
 available with Xen.
